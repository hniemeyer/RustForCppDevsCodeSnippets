## Notes to self

- have type annotations in our copy-pasteable examples to reduce confusion


# Ablauf

- mini intro: what's Rust and why
- Mutability
- copy & move semantics
- *then* ownership & borrowing [Lotte: PR for Rust part ~> Then C++ Perspective]
- multithreading
- channels
- tokio
- ðŸ‘€ throwback to mutability, ownership, borrowing, move semantics
- tests
- error handling
- thiserror crate
- anyhow crate
- traits & generics
    * âœ¨ derive âœ¨
- Iterators and Itertools


## Infrastructure

- compiler explorer & rust playground


## Topics

- .. those already covered in the slides

- basic syntax (types, functions, structs, ...)
- ownership and borrowing
- multithreading
- channels
- tokio
- ðŸ‘€ throwback to mutability, ownership, borrowing, move semantics
- tests
- error handling
- thiserror crate
- anyhow crate
- traits & generics
    * âœ¨ derive âœ¨
- Iterators and Itertools
- IDE support
* R-A away from VSCode?
* jetbrains rust plugin
* debugger "just works" in VSCode + R-A
* vscode crates extension
- Cargo.toml vs. CMake
-> show what Cargo.toml looks like
- how to add a dep & re-build

## small things

- pattern matching
    - caution: maybe gotta explain enums too
- maybe prepare/re-use FFI slide in case of questions
